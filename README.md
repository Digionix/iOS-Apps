# iOS Developer Portfolio 

Hello! I'm Jonathan, an iOS Developer with a background in software testing, where I discovered a love for coding through automation. 
Over time, I felt a growing desire to go beyond testing and dive into building and designing full applications. 
This curiosity led me to pursue iOS development, where I could work on the full process of designing, building, and testing applications.

This portfolio includes a selection of projects where I've focused on creating smooth, engaging experiences using Swift, SwiftUI, and other iOS frameworks.
Each project showcases different aspects of iOS development, from architecture to functionality, and reflects my excitement for building apps that people love to use. 
Take a look around, and feel free to explore my work!

# [Pack Buddy](https://github.com/jonathanvieri/Pack-Buddy)
Pack Buddy was inspired by my own experience of trying to organize packing lists using the built-in Notes app on my phone.
Although Notes could get the job done, it never felt dedicated or organized enough for managing the details of packing for trips.
I wanted an app that would simplify the process, allowing me to track my progress and categorize items in a way that felt intuitive and travel-focused.

With Pack Buddy, I aimed to create a tool that organizes packing lists in a way that feels intuitive and enjoyable. 
The app offers customizable categories, progress tracking with visual indicators, and a layout tailored for trip planning.
By allowing users to create personalized packing lists and manage items within categories, Pack Buddy makes it easy to keep track of essentials and avoid the stress of last-minute packing.

# [Horizon](https://github.com/jonathanvieri/Horizon)
Horizon started as a way for me to dive deeper into SwiftUI and get hands-on with real-time data handling in iOS development. 
I wanted to build something that was both useful and easy to use, so I decided on a weather app that provides local forecasts and air quality index (AQI) data.

Working on Horizon gave me the perfect chance to really dig into SwiftUI and see how I could bring together a clean design with live data. 
Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API was a great learning experience, especially as I tackled real-time updates and data caching. 
Through this project, I got to refine my skills in API handling, error management, and creating a responsive, intuitive interface.

# [BMI Me](https://github.com/jonathanvieri/bmi-me)
BMI Me is the first app I built independently with SwiftUI, right after learning the framework. 
I wanted to create a simple yet functional project on my own, without following a tutorial, to really cement my understanding of SwiftUI basics. 
This BMI calculator app lets users quickly calculate their BMI based on height and weight, and provides advice based on the result.
