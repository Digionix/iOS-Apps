# iOS Developer Portfolio 

Hello! I'm Jonathan, an iOS Developer with a background in software testing, where I discovered a love for coding through automation. 
Over time, I felt a growing desire to go beyond testing and dive into building and designing full applications. 
This curiosity led me to pursue iOS development, where I could work on the full process of designing, building, and testing applications.

This portfolio includes a selection of projects where I've focused on creating smooth, engaging experiences using Swift, SwiftUI, and other iOS frameworks.
Each project showcases different aspects of iOS development, from architecture to functionality, and reflects my excitement for building apps that people love to use. 
Take a look around, and feel free to explore my work!

# [Horizon](https://github.com/jonathanvieri/Horizon)
Horizon started as a way for me to dive deeper into SwiftUI and get hands-on with real-time data handling in iOS development. 
I wanted to build something that was both useful and easy to use, so I decided on a weather app that provides local forecasts and air quality index (AQI) data.

Working on Horizon gave me the perfect chance to really dig into SwiftUI and see how I could bring together a clean design with live data. 
Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API was a great learning experience, especially as I tackled real-time updates and data caching. 
Through this project, I got to refine my skills in API handling, error management, and creating a responsive, intuitive interface.
