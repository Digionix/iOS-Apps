# iOS Developer Portfolio 

Hello! I'm Jonathan, an iOS Developer with a background in software testing, where I discovered a love for coding through automation. 
Over time, I felt a growing desire to go beyond testing and dive into building and designing full applications. 
This curiosity led me to pursue iOS development, where I could work on the full process of designing, building, and testing applications.

This portfolio includes a selection of projects where I've focused on creating smooth, engaging experiences using Swift, SwiftUI, and other iOS frameworks.
Each project showcases different aspects of iOS development, from architecture to functionality, and reflects my excitement for building apps that people love to use. 
Take a look around, and feel free to explore my work!
